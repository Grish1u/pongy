   Implement a score tracking mechanism for each player. Update the `GameTable` class to keep track of player scores and display them on the screen.

2. **Winning Conditions:**
   Introduce winning conditions for the game, such as reaching a certain score. When a player wins, display a victory screen and provide an option to restart the game.

   Enhance the game over handling. Display a game-over screen when the game ends and offer options to restart or quit the game.

4. **Game States:**
   Implement different game states (e.g., main menu, gameplay, game over). The `GameTable` class can manage the transition between these states.

5. **Power-Ups and Effects:**
   Add power-ups or special effects that can affect gameplay. Modify the `GameTable` class to handle the activation and effects of these power-ups.

6. **AI Opponent:**
   If you want to add a single-player mode, implement an AI opponent. The `GameTable` class would handle interactions with the AI player.

7. **Sound Effects and Music:**
   Integrate sound effects and background music. The `GameTable` class can manage playing and stopping audio based on game events.

8. **Pause and Resume:**
   Allow players to pause the game and resume later. Update the `GameTable` class to handle pause and resume functionality.
